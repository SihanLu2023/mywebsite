# Climate change and temperature anomalies

If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined
Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the
Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space
Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of
temperature anomalies can be found
here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base,
period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between
1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and
`na`.

1.  The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in
    Row 2, so we need to skip one row.
2.  `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the
    spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see
    that missing data is coded as "\*\*\*". It is best to specify this
    here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric
    data.

Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled `weather`
in the `Environment` panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the
top-right), go to `Tools` \> `Global Options` \> `Pane Layout` and tick
the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and
the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of
temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide
format.

You have two objectives in this section:

1.  Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather`
    dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this
    assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

2.  Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use
    `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as
    `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as
    `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.

```{r tidyweather}
tidyweather <- weather %>% 
               select(1:13) %>% 
               pivot_longer(!Year, names_to = "Month", values_to = "delta")
```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for

1.  year,
2.  month, and
3.  delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a
trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called
`date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot
chronologically.

> In the following chunk of code, I used the `eval=FALSE` argument,
> which does not run a chunk of code; I did so that you can knit the
> document before tidying the data and creating a new dataframe
> `tidyweather`. When you actually want to run this code and knit your
> document, you must delete `eval=FALSE`, **not just here but in all
> chunks were `eval=FALSE` appears.**

```{r scatter_plot, eval=FALSE}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs ( 
    x = "Date",
    y = "Temperature deviation",
    title = "Weather Anomalies",
  ) 

```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to
study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as
1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calcuialtes
a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base periof of 1951-1980.
The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups
data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010
and 2011-present.

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the
`mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains
information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign
the different periods using `case_when()`.

```{r intervals, eval=FALSE}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the
`Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot
to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by
the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to
`interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot, eval=FALSE}
library(viridis)
ggplot(comparison, aes(x = delta, fill = interval)) +
  geom_density(alpha=.6) +
 # theme(legend.position="none") +
  theme_bw()+
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = "D") +
  labs(x = "Delta",
       y = "Density",
       title = "Distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`) grouped by the different time periods")

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might
be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using
`group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display
the result.

```{r averaging, eval=FALSE}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(mean_delta = mean(delta, na.rm = TRUE))

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x = Year, y = mean_delta)) +
  geom_point() +
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth(method = loess) +
  #change theme to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Year", 
       y = "Mean tenperature deviation")

```

## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their
website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php)
that

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast
> amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that
> much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge
> the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual
delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation
with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has
already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we
are only interested in what is happening between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula, eval=FALSE}

comparison1 <- comparison %>% 
               summarise(delta = mean(delta, na.rm = TRUE))

#using formula
formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
              # filter by interval
              filter(interval == "2011-present") %>% 
              # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta) 
              summarize(mean_delta = mean(delta,na.rm=TRUE),
                        sd_delta = sd(delta,na.rm=TRUE),
                        count = n(),
                        t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1),
                        se_delta = sd_delta/sqrt(count),
                        error_margin = t_critical*se_delta,
                        delta_low = mean_delta - error_margin,
                        delta_high = mean_delta + error_margin)

#print out formula_CI
formula_ci

set.seed(1234)
bootstrap_ci <- comparison %>% 
  filter(interval == '2011-present') %>% 
  specify(response = delta) %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = 'bootstrap') %>%
# Find the mean of each sample
  calculate(stat = 'mean') %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = 'percentile')

bootstrap_ci

```

# Biden's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls
that track the president's
approval](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

#glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
approval_polllist$modeldate <- mdy(approval_polllist$modeldate)
approval_polllist$startdate <- mdy(approval_polllist$startdate)
approval_polllist$enddate <- mdy(approval_polllist$enddate)
approval_polllist$createddate <- mdy(approval_polllist$createddate)

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval
rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I
want you plot the net approval for each week in 2022, along with its 95%
confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please
use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended. Your plot should look
something like this:


```{r}
# Calculate the average net approval rate for each week and its 95% confidence interval
avg_approval_rate <- approval_polllist %>%
  mutate(week = week(enddate), #get week out of the enddate
         year = year(enddate), #get year out of the enddate
         avg_net_approval = (approve-disapprove)) %>% #calculate the average net approval
  filter(year == 2022) %>%  #fitler by year 2022
  group_by(subgroup,week) %>%  #group by subgroup and week
  summarize(avg_net_approval, 
            mean = mean(avg_net_approval, na.rm = TRUE),  #calcualte mean of the average net approval
            sd = sd(avg_net_approval,na.rm = TRUE),  #calculate standard deviation of the average net approval
            count = n(),  
            error=(qt(0.95, df = count - 1)*sd/sqrt(count)), #calculate the margin of error
            diff_rate_low  = mean - error,  #lower bound of the 95% confidence interval
            diff_rate_high = mean + error)  #upper bound of the 95% confidence interval

#Plot the data
ggplot(avg_approval_rate) +
  aes(x=week, y = mean) +  #plot the average net approval
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~subgroup, nrow = 3, strip.position="right")+  #group by subgroup and devide in 3 different graphs
  geom_ribbon(alpha=0.3, fill = "orange") +  #plot the confidence interval
  aes(ymin = diff_rate_low, ymax = diff_rate_high, colour = subgroup) +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  labs(title = "Biden's Net Approval Ratings in 2022", 
              subtitle = "Weekly Data, Approve - Disapprove, %", 
              caption = "Source: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data",
              x = "Week in 2022",

# Challenge 1: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We
can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```

We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and
year since 2015


However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the
following two graphs.


The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of
weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to Q2 (weeks
14-26) and Q4 (weeks 40-52).


For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of
rentals per week or month between 2016-2019 and then, see how each
week/month of 2020-2022 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the
calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`.

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected
rentals? Why?
We should use the mean to calculate the expected rentals. From the distribution of rentals in past eight years, we could tell that the distributions are closed. The distributions are closed to normal distribution and the mean works perfectly well for a normal distribution.
Furthermore, not many outliers exists and the amount of data we use is huge and it can reduce the effect of outliers. Some outliers are caused by events that could happen again in the future.

# Challenge 2: Share of renewable energy production in the world

The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has a a very interesting

```

This is a very rich data set, not just for energy and CO2 data, but for
many other technologies. In our case, we just need to produce a couple
of graphs-- at this stage, the emphasis is on data manipulation, rather
than making the graphs gorgeous.

First, produce a graph with the countries with the highest and lowest %
contribution of renewables in energy production. This is made up of
`elec_hydro`, `elec_solar`, `elec_wind`, and `elec_renew_other`. You may
want to use the *patchwork* package to assemble the two charts next to
each other.

```{r min-max_renewables, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
e_plot <- energy %>%
  select(variable,year,value,country) %>%
  filter(variable %in% c("elec_hydro","elecprod","elec_solar","elec_wind","elec_renew_other"), year==2019)
  
  piv1 <- pivot_wider(e_plot, names_from = variable, values_from = value) %>%
  summarise(country, energy_contribution_per=(elec_hydro + elec_solar + elec_wind +   elec_renew_other)/elecprod) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = energy_contribution_per,n=20) %>% 
  arrange(desc(energy_contribution_per),desc(country))
  
  piv2 <- pivot_wider(e_plot, names_from = variable, values_from = value) %>%
  summarise(country, energy_contribution_per=(elec_hydro + elec_solar + elec_wind +   elec_renew_other)/elecprod) %>%
  slice_min(order_by = desc(energy_contribution_per),n=-20) %>% 
  slice_min(order_by = energy_contribution_per,n=20) %>% 
    arrange((energy_contribution_per),(country))
  
  graph1 <- ggplot(piv1, aes(x=energy_contribution_per,y=reorder(country,energy_contribution_per))) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + labs(title="Energy Contributions per Country",x="Energy",y="Country") + scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))
  
  graph2 <- ggplot(piv2, aes(y=reorder(country,energy_contribution_per),x=energy_contribution_per)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + labs(title="Energy Contributions per Country",x="Energy",y="Country") + scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))
  
graph1 + graph2 +
  plot_annotation(title = "Highest and lowest % of renewables in energy production",
                  subtitle = "2019 data")
```

Second, you can produce an animation to explore the relationship between
CO2 per capita emissions and the deployment of renewables. As the % of
energy generated by renewables goes up, do CO2 per capita emissions seem
to go down?

```{r animation, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
energy_select <- c('elec_hydro', 'elec_solar', 'elec_wind', 'elec_renew_other')
energy_analysis3 <- energy %>% 
                   filter(variable %in% energy_select) %>% 
                   group_by(country, year) %>% 
                   summarise(total_renewable_energy = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE)) 

energy_analysis4 <- energy %>% 
                   filter(variable == 'elecprod') %>% 
                   group_by(country, year) %>% 
                   summarise(total_energy = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE)) 

energy_analysis5 <- left_join(energy_analysis3, energy_analysis4, by = c("country", "year")) %>% 
                   mutate(percent_contribution = total_renewable_energy/total_energy) %>% 
                   select(country, year, percent_contribution) %>% 
                   filter(percent_contribution != 0, !is.na(percent_contribution) )

joined_energy <- left_join(energy_analysis5, co2_percap, on = c(country, year))

joined_energy_new <- joined_energy %>% 
  mutate(year_new = as.integer(year))
joined_energy_new

joined_energy2 <- left_join(joined_energy_new, countries, on = iso3c) %>% drop_na()

ggplot(data = joined_energy2, aes(x = percent_contribution, y = value, colour = income_level)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~income_level) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', 
       x = '% renewables', 
       y = 'CO2 per cap') +
  transition_time(year_new) +
  ease_aes('linear') +theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position="none")

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "animation.gif"), error = FALSE)
```

To create this animation is actually straight-forward. You manipulate
your date, and the create the graph in the normal ggplot way. the only
`gganimate` layers you need to add to your graphs are

      labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', 
           x = '% renewables', 
           y = 'CO2 per cap') +
      transition_time(year) +
      ease_aes('linear')

# Deliverables

As usual, there is a lot of explanatory text, comments, etc. You do not
need these, so delete them and produce a stand-alone document that you
could share with someone. Knit the edited and completed R Markdown file
as an HTML document (use the "Knit" button at the top of the script
editor window) and upload it to Canvas.

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all
components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same
type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the
variables being analyzed.

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes.
Easy to follow (both the code and the output).

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly
and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both
self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used
tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled.
Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled
clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret
the output.
